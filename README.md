This Django project provides extremely simple API for writing and reading domains reported by [Censor Tracker](https://git.io/JfoBg). 
This is a part of the mechanism which will help us to detect DPI locks initiated by the government services.

Pre Requirements
================

- Docker
- PyCharm (or any other IDE/Editor)
- RabbitMQ


Configuring Rabbit
==================

On configuring Celery do not forget to add vhost for your stack, like this:

```
docker exec -i -t RABBIT_CONTAINER_ID_HERE bash -c 'rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p /STACK_NAME_HERE RABBIT_USER_HERE ".*" ".*" ".*"'
```

In our case, `STACK_NAME` can be `dev.censortracker` or `censortracker`.

Running
=======

Just run this command:

    ~ bash meta/local-dev/deploy.sh -s
    
 
API
===
 
This web-site provides two endpoints:

```
POST /domain/
GET /domains/
```
